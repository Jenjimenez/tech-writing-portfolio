## Respond and Screen for Motivation

### High-Priority Leads (Push to CRM)
High-priority leads are those who show strong interest in selling their property. These leads should be processed immediately to maximize conversion opportunities.

#### Criteria for High-Priority Leads:
- They ask for an offer and provide an email address.
- They confirm interest in selling and respond to initial questions, even if they don't provide an email.

#### Steps to Process High-Priority Leads:
1. Mark as "Warm" in Launch Control.
2. Add the "Push to CRM" tag to categorize the lead appropriately.
3. Push the lead to Launch Control (CRM) to initiate follow-up actions.
4. Notify the Acquisitions Manager, who will contact the lead for further discussion.

### Medium-Priority Leads (Require Further Action)

#### Criteria for Medium-Priority Leads:
- Leads who ask, "What's your offer?" but don't answer follow-ups within a day.
- Leads from nurture campaigns who respond after being pushed to the CRM before.

#### Steps to Process Medium-Priority Leads:
- "What's your offer" leads:
  - Add these to the **"Call them"** Discord channel for follow-up by the acquisitions manager.
  - Add **"Call them"** tag in Launch Control.
  - If no response in a day, push to drip campaigns.
- Leads from nurture campaigns:
  - Check Launch Control notes and respond accordingly.
  - If no notes are available, ask acquisitions manager about the lead's story.
  - Add **"CAPD"** tag in Launch Control.

### Low-Priority Leads (Do Not Push Yet)

#### Criteria for Low-Priority Leads:
- Leads requiring information verification (e.g., ownerâ€™s name, wrong number).
- Leads who ask to be called without providing information or agreeing to sell.

#### Steps to Process Low-Priority Leads:
- Add these to the **"Call them"** Discord channel for verification by Acquisitions Manager before adding to Follow Up Boss.
- Do not push to the CRM until verified.

## Manage Leads

### High-Priority Leads
- Mark as "Warm" in Launch Control.
- Add "Push to CRM" tag.
- Push to CRM (Follow Up Boss).

### Medium-Priority Leads
- Tag appropriately ("Call them" or "CAPD").
- Follow up per SOP guidelines in Medium-Priority leads (Require further action).

### Low-Priority Leads
- Add to **"Call them"** Discord channel.
- Wait for verification before adding to CRM.

## Daily Follow-up Tasks
- Add all nurture leads from the previous day to the "Yes, then ghosted" drip.
- The acquisitions manager will update their status in Launch Control and add relevant notes.

## Best Practices
- Change one word in templates weekly to keep messages fresh.
- Always check Launch Control notes before responding to leads from drip campaigns.
- When in doubt about a lead's status or motivation, consult with the acquisitions manager.

## Review and Update Frequency
This SOP should be reviewed quarterly to ensure it remains effective and up to date.
