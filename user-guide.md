## Configuring Flow Triggers

### Step 1: Choose the Trigger Type
1. Navigate to the **Triggers** section in the flow editor.
2. Select from various triggers:
   - **Page Load**: Trigger the flow when a user visits a specific page.
   - **Element Interaction**: Start the flow when a user interacts with a specific element (e.g., clicks a button).
   - **URL Path**: Set the flow to start when a user visits a certain URL.

### Step 2: Set Conditions
- You can configure conditions to ensure the flow triggers at the right time. For instance, you might only show onboarding steps after a user logs in for the first time.

## Best Practices for Onboarding

1. **Keep It Simple**: Focus on the most important tasks users need to accomplish. Don't overwhelm them with too many steps.
2. **Use Visuals**: Use screen annotations, arrows, and highlights to guide users through each step.
3. **Be Concise**: Use short, clear instructions. Avoid lengthy explanations to maintain engagement.
4. **Interactive Elements**: Engage users with interactive elements such as quizzes or checklists to encourage active participation.
5. **Timing**: Trigger flows at key points in the user journey (e.g., immediately after sign-up or after a user completes a key action).

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Flow Not Triggering
- **Cause**: Incorrect trigger settings or wrong element selection.
- **Solution**: Double-check the trigger conditions and ensure they match the intended interaction or page.

### Issue 2: Steps Not Appearing Correctly
- **Cause**: Incorrect step timings or z-index conflicts with other page elements.
- **Solution**: Adjust the step timing and review any potential conflicts with other on-page elements.

### Issue 3: User Dropped Off Mid-Flow
- **Cause**: A complicated step or interruption in the flow.
- **Solution**: Review the analytics to identify the drop-off point and simplify or clarify that section.
