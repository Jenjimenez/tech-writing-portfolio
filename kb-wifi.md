## Best Practices for Onboarding

### 1. Keep It Simple and Focused
Limit the flow to 3-5 key actions that users need to understand. Avoid overloading users with too much information at once.

### 2. Use Visual Cues
Enhance your flow with visuals like arrows, highlights, or even short videos to improve user understanding.

### 3. Set Up Contextual Help
Make sure that flows are triggered at the most relevant moments in the userâ€™s journey (e.g., when they first sign up or when they attempt a complex task).

## Troubleshooting

### Flow Not Triggering:
- **Issue**: The flow does not start when expected.
- **Solution**: Check if the correct trigger is selected. Ensure that the conditions (e.g., page load, element interaction) match the intended action.

### Flow Steps Not Appearing Correctly:
- **Issue**: Some steps do not display as expected.
- **Solution**: Review the CSS or JavaScript on the page to ensure no conflicts. Adjust the timing or placement of your flow elements.
